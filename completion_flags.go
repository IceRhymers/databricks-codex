// flagDefs is the ordered list of root flags fed to pkg/completion for
// shell-script generation. Order is curated here (not implied by the tree)
// because bash/zsh/fish completion output is order-sensitive — preserving
// byte-equivalence with the pre-tree binary requires the original ordering
// (--profile first, --port toward the end). Each entry is derived from
// rootCommand so the tree remains the single source of truth for which
// flags exist and what their descriptions / completers / arg semantics are.
// #89 removed --headless and --idle-timeout from this slice (alongside the
// rootCommand.Flags removal); they live on serveCommand now and are
// reachable via the recursive subcommand-tree wiring in
// rootCommand.CompletionSubcommands().
//
// Adding a new root flag requires:
//  1. Append a FlagDef to rootCommand.Flags (or .Persistent) in commands.go.
//  2. Insert the new flag's name into the order slice below at the desired
//     position in the completion output.
// The init-time panic and the parity tests in main_test.go fail loudly if
// step 2 is forgotten or if a name in `order` doesn't appear on rootCommand.

	// here is independent of that partitioning.

// bump to databricks-claude v1.0.2 (which exports SubcommandDef); #88
// adds the hooks branch; #89 adds the serve leaf — picked up
// automatically by the recursive walk now that serveCommand sits on
// rootCommand.Subcommands. See the doc-comment in internal/cmd/cmd.go
// for the prior #86 omission.
